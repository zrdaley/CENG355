# CENG355

The code in this repository is designed to run on the STM32F0 ARM Cortex-M0 Microcontroller

## Lab1

This purpose of this lab was to use the STM32F0 Discovery board to measure the frequency and period of a square-wave and display on the console.

## Project 

This purpose of this project was to use the STM32F0 Discovery board to measure the voltage across an external potentiometer in order to monitor and control the pulse-width-modulated frequency generated by an external timer.
